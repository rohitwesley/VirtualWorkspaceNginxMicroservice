## Introduction

Follow the same pattern as this repo

## Features

- Git Flow versioning patter i.e master/develop/feature/hot-fix/release
- Dockerised Container setup
- Docker-Compose script for dockerised automation

## Prerequisites

Before you can install and use the this Micro Server, ensure that you have the following software installed on your system:

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) (v20.10.0 or later)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) (v2.25.0 or later)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)

## Project Structure

```

template_microserver
    └── template/
|   |-- .dockerignore
|   |-- .env
|   ├── .gitignore
├   |── Dockerfile
├   |── docker-compose.yml
|   |-- README.md
```

- `Dockerfile`: Defines the Docker configuration for the Node.js server.
- `README.md`: This file, containing project information and instructions.
- `docker-compose.yml`: Defines the Docker Compose configuration for the web and Template services.
- `.env.example`: Example environment variables file for custom port configuration.
- `template/`: Directory containing microserver core files.

## Installation

To install the Template Micro Server, follow these steps:

1. Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) if they are not already installed on your system.

2. Clone the repository and navigate to the `template_microserver` folder.
```
git clone https://github.com/user/template-microserver.git
cd template-microserver
```

3. Copy the `.env.example` file to a new file called `.env`, and update the variables as necessary.
```
cp .env.example .env
```
4. Build the Docker image:
```
docker-compose build
```
5. Run the server using Docker Compose:
```
docker-compose up
```
5. Access the dashboard web app at `http://localhost:<APP_PORT>` (replace `<APP_PORT>` with the port specified in the .env file).

## Stopping the Template Microserver

To stop the Template microserver, run the following command from the template_microserver directory:

```
docker-compose down
```

This will stop and remove the Template container, as well as any associated networks and volumes.


The server should now be up and running on your specified port.

## .env

The `.env` file contains environment variables that are used to configure the Template Micro Server. Here's a breakdown of the available variables and their default values:

You can override any of these variables by creating a new `.env` file in the root of the project and setting the desired variables. Make sure to restart the server after modifying the `.env` file for changes to take effect.

## Usage

```

```

## API Documentation

```

```

The server supports the standard Template commands. For a full list of commands and their usage, refer to the [Template official documentation](https://template.io/commands).

## Examples
```

```
For more examples and use cases, refer to the [Template official documentation](https://template.io/documentation).

## Testing

```

```
If the test is successful, the Template microserver is working properly.
For more examples and use cases, refer to the [Template official documentation](https://template.io/documentation).


## Troubleshoot

It seems that the Template container is exiting immediately after starting up. This could be due to an issue with the Template configuration file or some other configuration issue.

Here are some steps you can take to troubleshoot the issue:

>---
>1. Check the Template logs by running the following command:
>
> This will display the logs for the Template container and may provide some clues as to why it is exiting.
>```
>docker logs template-microserver
>```
>or
>```
>docker-compose logs template-microserver
>```
>---
>2. Check the Template configuration file by running the following command:
>
> This will display the contents of the Template configuration file. Make sure that it is properly configured and that there are no syntax errors.
>```
>docker exec template-microserver cat /usr/local/etc/template/template.conf
>```
>---
>3. Check if the Template container is running on the specified port by running the following command:
>
> This will display a list of all running containers. Look for the "template" container and make sure that it is running on the expected port.
>```
>docker ps
>```
>---
>4. Try running the Template container without the Docker Compose file by running the following command:
>
> This will start the Template container interactively and display the container logs in real time. You can then try to connect to Template and see if it is working properly.
>```
>docker run -it --rm --name template-test template
>```
